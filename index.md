## Projects

### Code Racer
![Code Racer Logo](/img/coderacer-small.png)
[Code Racer][coderacer] is a multiplayer web coding game built by the team at
Treehouse in 4 days. It was built with Node, Spine, Socket.io and
CoffeeScript. I managed the client server interaction that managed the
real-time communication between clients. I also worked to create the
interactive UI which the players used to type their code and keep track
of the game.


### Brickify

![Brickify Team](http://brickify.com/images/team.jpg)
[Brickify][brickify] allows you to turn your images into real life lego creations.
When you supply an image, Brickify will deconstruct it and build you a
schematic for turning your image into a lego sign.

Brickify runs entirely within the web browser, using JavaScript and
canvas to analyze the source image and create the optimal plan for the
brick project. You can check out and contribue on
[Github][brickify-github].
